# THYROID COMPLICATING PREGNANCY

## INCIDENCE

- hyper - 0.1 to 0.4%
- hypo 2-3%
- thyroid antibodies 5-10%

## PHYSIOLOGY
- tsh reduced due to beta hcg
- tbg inc due to estrogen and inc hepatic synthesis
- t3, t4 inc

## HYPOTHROIDISM 

**COMPLICATIONS**

- miscarriage 
- stillbirth
- perinatal death
- preterm delivery
- fetal distress
- LBW

**DOC** - LT4 (levothyroxine)

starting dose 1-2 mcg/kg/day and adjusted every 4 weeks 

if dx before pregnancy

- adjust dose to have prepreg tsh <2.5 and maintain the same during first trimester and not exceed 3 in the second and third trimester
- may need a inc dose of about 30-50% during pregnancy to achieve target
- after pregnancy LT4 doses to be returned to prepregnancy dose and tsh checked 6-8 weeks postpartum

## THYROID AUTOIMMUNITY

- prenancy with TgAb or TPOab had a 2-4 fold inc in the risk of pregnancy loss

## HYPERTHROIDISM

goitre is a common clinical feature

fetal hyperthyroidism may manifest in the first 72 hours of life - treat with mmi 10-20 mg adjusting dose every few days

**COMPLICATIONS**

- stillbirth
- preterm
- iugr
- preeclampsia
- heart failure
- spontaneous abortion

findings include *TRAb (thyroid receptor antibodies)* - inc risk of thyrotoxicosis in fetus, tsh, ft4

**MANAGEMENT**

- drugs to keep ft4 in the upper 1/3rd of the normal non pregnant range or just above the normal range with the lowest possible dosage of drug
- adjust dose every 2-4 weeks 
- DOC - Propylthiouracil (PTU) in the first trimester only and methimazole (MMI) in the second and third trimester...carbimazole (cbm) can also be used (all are safe in breast feeding...mmi preferred in breastfeeding)
  - ptu dosage - 100-450 mg/day 
  - mmi dosage 10-20 mg/day
- beta blockers to control adrenergic symptoms of throtoxicosis and block t4 to t3 conversion...propranolol dosage 10-40mg q4h or q6h or atenolol 25-50 mg daily
- acute cases - esmolol 200mcg/kg/minute may be used to maintain a heart rate 90 bpm
- **SIDE EFFECTS**
  - PTU - hepatotoxicity 
  - MMI - methimazole embryopathy 
    - aplasia cutis  
    - choanal/esophageal atresia
    - hearing loss
    - dysmorphic facial features
    - developmental  delay
