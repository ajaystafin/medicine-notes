# POST PRANDIAL HYPERGLYCEMIA


more important than fasting levels - independent risk factor 

depends on 

Postprandial excursion of blood glucose level is dependent upon several rate-limiting factors, including 
- time course of gastric emptying, 
- intestinal absorptive rate of glucose, 
- decreased insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissues, 
- decreased suppression of hepatic glucose output (glycogenolysis) after meals, 
- rate of gluconeogenesis of the liver, 
- insulin secretion rate during postprandial period, and 
- autonomic nerve imbalance of sympathetic and parasympathetic nerve.

- inc ppbs is the first sign of deranged glucose metabolism -> mainly due to decreased incretins -> amylin, gip- glucose dependent inhibitory peptide , glp -> glucagon like peptide

<code>
<b>GLP:
- inc insulin release
- dec glucagon release
- slows down gastric emptying - thus inc satiety
</b>
</code>
 
- fasting hyperglycemia responsible for microvascular complications 
- post prandial hyperglycemia resposible for macrovascualar complications (but most important factor hypertriglyceridemia   in many cases caused by insulin resistance)
