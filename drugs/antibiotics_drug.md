# ANTIBIOTICS

1. obtain a **microbiological diagnosis**  - through clinical presentation, specimens submitted to the lab
not needed for common stuff eg.

* cellulitis - staph, strep
* cap community aquired pneumonia - macrolide, fluoroquinolones
* meningitis in otherwise healthy adult - n. meningitis, strep pneumoniae - 3rd gen cephalosporins + vanco 
* hospital aquired infiections eg. CAUTI - MRSA present in the skin
> NOTE: take a nasal swab routinely to determine the organism colonizing the skin eg.mrsa before admitting to the ICU 

2. timing 

* immediate - spetic shock, febrile neutropenic pts, bacterial meningitis - empiric therapy initiated 
* wait for labs(chronic conditions req long term therapy) - bacterial endocarditis, veterbral osteomyelitis  

3. emptiric vs definitive

* if empiric - broad spectrum 
  * eg. meningitis in otherwise healthy adult - n. meningitis, strep pneumoniae - 3rd gen cephalosporins + vanco 
* if definitive take steps to use narrow spectrum antibiotisc
