# INTUBATION

assess airway difficulty 
anticipate required airway rescue (supraglottic airway) 
sufficient personnel present
assign all tasks in advance **(use checklist)**
  - medication administration
  - cervical spine stabilisation
  - external laryngeal manipulation etc.
prepare drugs 
preoxygenate with non-rebreather o2 mask(15L/min), nippv, mask ventilation to keep oxygenation > 93%
use nasal canula at 15L/min during intubation for apneic oxygenation 
optimise physiology - fluid, inotropes, vasopressors
sniffing position - avoid in c spine trauma(use inline stabilisation) 
rapid sequence induction
tube insertion
confirmation with etco2 
abort intubation attempt if spo2 dropping and begin mask ventilation
## INTUBATION TRAY
1. suction
2. bag valve mask
3. rescue device (supraglottic aiway)
4. intubation tube 7.5mm - females, 8mm - males
5. fentanyl 3mcg/kg (pre treatment - optional)
6. iv induction by rapid flush - etomidate(.3mg/kg), ketamine(1-2mg/kg), propofol(0.5-1.5mg/kg)
7. followed by rapid flush of iv paralytic agent - succinylchoine 1-2mg/kg, rocuronium 1-1.5mg/kg 
8.
