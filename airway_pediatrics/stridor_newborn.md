# STRIDOR IN NEWBORN
[reference](https://www.aafp.org/afp/1999/1115/p2289.html#:~:text=Generally%2C%20an%20inspiratory%20stridor%20suggests,often%20result%20in%20voice%20changes.)

- high pitched harsh vibratory sound resulting form turbulent flow due to partial obstruction of the respiratory airway
- sign of upper airway obstruction

- inspiratory stridor - above glottis
- expiratory stridor - lower trachea
- biphasic - glottis or subglottis

- laryngeal lesions result in voice changes
- child with extrinsic airway obstruction hyperextends the neck

- Laryngotracheal stenosis

- Foreign body
- Cystic hygroma
- Subglottic hemangioma
- Laryngeal papilloma
- Angioneurotic edema
- Laryngospasm (hypocalcemic tetany)
- Psychogenic stridor
### Trachea
- Tracheomalacia
- Bacterial tracheitis
- External compression

### CHOANAL ATRESIA
[reference](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK507724/)

upto 90% of choanal atresia are bony and 10% are membranous
- unilateral - nasal discharge on the affected side, chronic sinusitis
- bilateral - acute airway obstruction

associated syndrome - CHARGE (coloboma, heart disease, atresia choanea, growth and mental retardation, gential hypoplasia, ear anomalies)

evaluate by
- placing a laryngeal mirror and checking for fogging
- introducing a suction catheter though each nostril and in to the child's oral cavity 

confirmed by flexible nasal endoscope, ct scan 

rx - surgical 
unilateral - after school age, using nasal saline spray until then
bilateral - et tube, [McGovern nipple](./mcgovern_nipple.png) to maintain oral airway

### THYROGLOSSAL CYST, LINGUAL THYROID

- [thyroglossal cyst] - midline swelling anywhere from just above the hyoid bone to the thyroid gland
- thyroglossal cyst - sistrunks procedure

[thyroglossal cyst]:https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK554494/


### MACROGLOSSIA

- [beckwith wiedemann syndrome], down syndrome, glycogen storage disease, congenital hypothyroidism

[beckwith wiedemann syndrome]:https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1394/

### MICROGNATHIA

- pierre robin syndrome, treacher collins syndrome, hallermann-streiff syndrome

### HYPERTROPHIC TONSILS/ADENOIDS

- stridor mostly during sleep(snoring)

### RETROPHARYNGEAL OR PERITONSILLAR ABSCESS

- fever, drooling, sysphagia
- retro - child keeps neck hyperextended
- peri - trismus+

## LARYNX

### LARYNGOMALACIA

- male:female ratio 2:1.1
- insp stricor worse in supine position, when crying or agitated or during uri

### LARYNGEAL WEB, CYST, LARYNGOCELE

- web - failure of the airway to recanalize - mostly at the level of vocal cord and are ant in location
- cyst - mostly in the aryepiglottic fold or in epiglottis, contains mucus from minor salivary glands
- laryngocele - dilatation of the saccule of the laryngeal ventricle 

### LARYNGOTRACHEOBRONCHITIS (VIRAL CROUP)

- most common cause of acute stridor in childhood
- parainfluenza most common, also inf a and b, rsv, rhinovirus
- 6months to 6years with peak at 2 years 
- usually preceded by uri of several days
- low grade fever, barking cough, inp stridor, hoarseness
- symptoms worse at night and aggravated by agitation and crying

### ACUTE SPASMODIC LARYNGITIS (SPASMODIC CROUP)

- same as viral croup except no preceding uri, and occurs suddenly at night
- etiology - allergy, psychological factors, gerd

### EPIGLOTTITIS 

- almost always by Hib
- incidence very less due to vaccination 
- incidence 2-7years with peak at 3 years
- abrupt onset of *high fever* toxicity, agitation, stridor, dyspnoea, muffled voice, dysphagia and drooling, no spontaneous cough
- edematous cherry red epiglottis is the hallmark

### VOCAL CORD PARALYSIS

- unilateral - mostly on left - left RLN injury - due to burth trauma, trauma during sx, compresison by masses of cardiac, pulmonary, esophageal, thyroid or lymphoid origin
- bilateral - cns problems like perinatal asphyxia, cerebral hemorrhage, hydrocephalus, bulbar injury, arnold chiari malformation
- can be injured during deep airway suction
- ul - weak cry
- bl - cry good but respiratory distress+

### LARYNGOTRACHEAL STENOSIS

- congenital
- most common - prolonged intubation and ventilation

### INTUBATION 

- causes vocal cord paralysis, laryngotracheal stenosis, subglottic edema and laryngospasm

### FOREIGN BODY

- choking with food
- laryngotracheal fb - cough stridor and dyspnoea
- bronchial foreign bodies - cougn dec breath sounds wheezing dysphagia

### CYSTIC HYGROMA

- congenital - collection of lymph channels that failed to connect to the normal pathway
- collection of lymphatic sacs that contain clear colorless lymph

### SUBGLOTTIC HEMANGIOMA

- biphasic stridor exaggerated by crying

### LARYNGEAL PAPILLOMA

- most common  laryngeal neoplasm in children
- vertical transmission of hpv at brth
- multiple in vocal cord (but can involve any part of larynx)
- most common bt 2-4 years
- presenting symptom hoarseness but some have stridor and other signs of laryngeal obstruction

### ANGIONEUROTIC EDEMA

- acute swelling of upper airway with stridor and dysnoea

### LARYNGOSPASM (HYPOCALCEMIC TETANY)

- rare
- other features irritability, tremors, twitching and carpopedal spams

### PSYCHOGENIC STRIDOR

- emotional stress or may be due to conversion disorder
- neck held in flexed position rather in extension

## TRACHEA

### TRACHEOMALACIA

- collapse of trachea
- trachea narrows during expiration and causes stridor
- aggravated by agitation and uri

### BACTERIAL TRACHEITIS

- staph aureus, also by hib, moraxella catarrhalis
- 3 years most common
- high fever, toxicity, respiratory distress

### EXTERNAL COMPRESSION

- double aortic arch, right aortic arch with left ligamentum arteriosum, anomalous innominate artery, anomalous left common carotid artery, anomalous left pumonary artery or aberrant subclavian artery, mediastinal cyst, teratoma, lymphoma, lymphadenopathy
- child keeps neck hyperextended
- aggravated by feeding
