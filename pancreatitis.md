# PANCREATITIS

# ACUTE PANCREATITIS
[reference](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482468/)

- leading cause of gi related hospitalization

## ETIOLOGY
- Alcohol
- Gall stones
- Hypertriglyceridemia
- Cystic fibrosis

## PATHOPHYSIOLOGY

alcohol(other toxins) -> inc atp depletion  -> ca+ not sequestered in SER -> elevated intraacinar calcium conc -> early activation of trypsinogen to trypsin -> activation of elastase and phospholipase -> localised tissue damage -> release of DAMPs(Damage Associated Molecular Patterns) -> systemic inflammatory cascade -> MODS

## HISTORY

- moderate to severe abdominal pain in the epigastrium with nause and anorexia
	- pain depends on etiology
		- biliary - sharp pain radiates to the back 
		- alcohol - dull and generalized pain
- fever
- tachycardia
- hypotension (in severe cases)
- abdominal examination 
	- epigastric tenderness with guarding 
	- rigidity 
	- decreased bowel sounds
- retroperitoneal bleeding (severe cases)
	- grey-turner - ecchymosis in flanks
- peritoneal hemorrhage 
 	- cullen's sign


## DIAGNOSIS

- Revised Atlanta Classification (2 of 3)
	1. lipase or amylase 3x the upper limit
	2. abdominal pain
	3. abdominal imaging

- to identify etiology
	- lab for biliary cholestasis
	- hypercalcemia
	- severe hyperlipidemia
	- usg for choledocholithiasis and bile duct obstruction
	
- to identify complications 
	- cxr - pleural effusion(indicates severity)
	- cect (if diagnosis is in doubt or pt fails to improve after 48 hrs of fluid resuscitation or to determine the presence of necrosis)
	- if diagnosis still in doubt after ct - mrcp or eus
	- diagnostic ercp - recurrent episodes of acute pancreatitis


## TREATMENT

- early aggressive fluid resuscitation
	- RL 15-20 ml/kg @ 3ml/kg/hour
	- monitored with blood urea nitrogen, hematocrit and urine output every 4-6 hours in the first 24 hours to adjust fluid rate
	- continue non response indiates - MODS

- Nil by mouth until abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, appetite and ileus improve
	- soft low residue low fat diet given initially
	- in severe cases naso jejunal feeding is preferred to parenteral nutriation

- prophylactic antibiotics not needed(antibiotics use is limited to presence of infected necrosis)

- treat etiology
	- glass stone pancreatitis - early cholecystectomy
	- early ercp (within 24 hours) for cholangitis and biliary obstruction
	- hypertriglyceridemia - tgl < 500 mg/dl

## COMPLICATIONS 
- Early(<24hours)
	* peripancreatic fluid collection - resolves spontaneously (10% result in pseudocyst)
	* peripancreatic necrosis (rx if symptomatic or infected(diagnosed by gas in ct)
- Late (>24hours)
	* pancreatic pseudocyst - resolve with observation with periodic ct or mri (drainage needed only in symptomatic or infected or enlarging cases) (drained using endoscopic transmural or transpapillary approach)
	* walled off necrosis

## DIFFERENTIAL

- Peptic ulcer disease
- Cholangitis
- Cholecystitis
- Bowel perforation
- Bowel obstruction
- Mesenteric ischemia
- Acute hepatitis
- Diabetic ketoacidosis
- Basilar pneumonia
- Myocardial infarction
- Renal colic
- Aortic dissection
