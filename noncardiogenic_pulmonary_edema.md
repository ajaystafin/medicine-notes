# NON CARDIOGENIC PULMONARY EDEMA

main mechanism - inc permeability and changes in pressure gradient within the pumonary capillaries and vaculature

differentiate from cardiogenic with PCWP(non cardiogenic <18mmhg)
lack of cardiac diseases
abssence of pedal edema
echo - lack of systolic/diastolic dysfunction

m/c cause - ards -a cure onset secondary to sepsis, pneumonia, gastic aspiration, blood transfusion, pacreatitis, multisystem trauma, trauma to the chest wall, drug overdose

ards diagnosis criteria: 
- b/l infiltrates on chest xray
- ratio of pao2/fio2 < 300mm hg with peep of 5cm h20
- without heart failure or hypervolemia

## Etiology


 Noncardiogenic pulmonary edema has a variety of etiologies (*all of which are rarer than cardiogenic pulmonary edema*) that include: 
    Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) - most common cause - includes many etiologies like sepsis, pneumonia, pancreatitis etc
    High altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE) - ascen above 2250m
    Neurogenic pulmonary edema 
    Opioid overdose 
    Salicylate toxicity 
    Pulmonary embolism
    Reexpansion pulmonary edema 
    Reperfusion pulmonary edema 

    Transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) - main cause of death in blood transfusion(but 1 in 5000 prbc transfused/1 in 2000 in plasma products/1 in 400 in whole blood products) - female donors have higher incidence of TRALI - due to HLA antibodies in parous females donors

## History and Physical

progressive dyspnoea
ask about opiod or salicylate use 
ask about etiologies of ards
blood transfusion - dyspnoes within 6hours of blood transfusion - trali
high altitude ascend
risk factors of pulmonary embolism
recent thoracic surgery

physical examination - jvp(normal), peripheral edema neg, normal fluid balance (differentiate from cardiogenic) 

## Evaluation
xray
echo - differentiate from cardiogenic source 
pcwp < 18mmhg
pao2/fio2 < 300 at peep 5mm h20 
if unilateral pulmonary edema - suspenct reperfusion/reexpansion pulmonary edema

## Treatment

treat undelying cause
supportive care 
ards - only supportive care and treat underlying disease

## Differential Diagnosis
* Cardiogenic Pulmonary edema
* pulmonary embolism

## Complication
* Ventilator dependent respiratory failure
