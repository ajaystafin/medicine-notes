# HEART FAILURE

two types 
1. HFpEF(common in elderly)
2. HFrEF
etilogy may be functional or structural
heart failure is preventable 
 Lack of diurnal variation in blood pressure and a widened pulse pressure have been identified as risk factors for FPE

Acute Heart Failure: heart failure of rapid progression that requires immediate intensive iv therapy
## Etiology

Risk Factors for Heart Failure [1] 

    Coronary artery disease (CAD)

    Connective tissue disorders (i.e., rheumatoid arthritis, scleroderma, systemic lupus erythematosus)

    Endocrine disorders (i.e., diabetes mellitus, thyroid function disorders, growth hormone deficiency)

    Hypertension

    High-output conditions (i.e.: anemia, Paget disease)

    Valvular heart disease

    Metabolic causes (i.e., obesity)

    Myocarditis (i.e., secondary to HIV/AIDS, medications, or viruses)

    Infiltrative disorders (i.e., amyloidosis, sarcoidosis)

    Peripartum cardiomyopathy

    Stress cardiomyopathy (Takotsubo)

    Valvular heart disease

    Medications (i.e., amphetamines, anabolic steroids)

    Tachycardia induced cardiomyopathy

    Toxins (i.e., cocaine, alcohol)

    Nutritional deficiency (i.e., L-carnitine deficiency, thiamine)

Etiology of ACude Decompensated Heart Failure/Flash Pulmonary Edema:

worsening of heart failure requiring iv therapy
dramatic and rapid in onset 
for pt with preexisting hf - there is often a clear trigger for decompensation
**POTENTIAL TRIGGERS**
* arrhythmia
* acute cad
* infection
* worsening hypertension(hypertensive crisis)
* medication non adherence 
* acute renal artery stenosis
* lv diastolic dysfuction
* ovstructive sleep apnea syndrome
* stress cardiomyopathy(takotsubo cardiomyopathy)

## History and Physical examination

mainly a clinical diagnosis

> It is important to ensure that there is a broad differential diagnosis and to avoid anchoring bias, premature closer, and diagnostic inertia.
