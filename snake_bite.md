# SNAKEBITE
[reference](./snakebite.pdf)
## SNAKES

1. Viper - hemo 
2. cobra, krait - neuro
3. sea snake - myotoxic

- kraits bite mostly at night
- cobraas and vipers at day or early darkness

## RECOMENDATIONS

### 1.  General 
1. dont move limb - immobilisation using splint or bandages
2. no tourniques
3. remove tournique after establising iv line 
4. local asv not recommended
5. fang mark may be very samll in krait(use magnifying lens) 
6. neuro symptoms appear within 30mins - 6hrs (cobra) and 6-24hrs for krait

### 2. Clinical Features
1. neuro (earliest sign furrowing of forehead 2nd ptosis)
  - 5 Ds – dyspnoea, dysphonia, dysarthria, diplopia, dysphagia 
  - 2 Ps – ptosis, paralysis 
2. hemo:
  - Local swelling, bleeding, blistering, and necrosis
  - Signs of compartment  syndrome (inc pain on  passive movement)
  - Tender enlargement of local draining lymph node
  - signs of systemic bleeding 
  - consumption coagulopathy develops < 30 min - detected by 20wbct
  - aki
  - hypotension

### 3. Diagnosis
1. 20wbct for hemotoxic 
  - incase clotted every 1hr/3hrs then every 6hrs/24hrs
  - in case not clotted - administer asv and see every 6hrs 
2. trial of anticholinesterase - in case of neurotoxic envenomation 

### 3. Management
1. if there is spontaneous abnormal bleeding from the bite site - start asv without 20 wbct
2. AN - atropine neostigmine (atropine 0.05mg/kg + neostigmine 0.04mg/kg IV(childre 0.01mg/kg)) - repeat AN(0.05mg A + 0.5mg N) every 30 for 5 doses then taper dose at 1 hr, 2hr, 6hrs and 12hrs - positive response is a 50% recovery in ptoses in one hour 
  - stop if pt. recovered, bradycardia/fasciculations, no imporvment after 3 doses
  - no AN injection in confirmed krait bite
  - **if no improvement after 3 doses could be krait(presynaptic block)**
  - if krait bite then give calcium gluconate 10ml IV (children 1-2 ml/kg) over 10mins every 6hours and continue till paralysis recovers (usually 5-7 days)
3. **ASV** 
  - neuro: 10vials over 30 mins followed by 2nd dose fof 10 vials withing 1hr if no improvement
  - hemmo: 10 vials over 1 hr every 6 hours(can repeat after 1-2 hrs if bleeding is profuse) - if nto working after 3 doses use FFP or cryoprecipitate or fresh whole blood(if former are unavailable)
4. sc epinephrine 0.25 mg sc (0.005/kg sc in children) can be given prophylactically in pts who are at high risk of anaphylaxis also hydrocort 200mg adn cpm 22.75mg can be given prophylactically
5. treatment for anaphylaxis - 0.5 mg adrenaline im (0.01mg/kg)
6. compartment syndrome: 
  - treat only after treating hemotological abnormalisties 
  - treat **only after confirming** with [saline manometer](./compartment_syndrome.mp4), vascular doppler, rising cpk, bedside compartment pressure measurement procedures - >30mmhg
