# ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME

disease causing poor oxygenation, pulmonary infiltrates and acuity of onset - caused by endothelial injury and diffuse alveolar damage causing pulmo artery contstriction, pulmonary hypertension and hypercoagulability
Starts within 7 days of the inciting event + b/l lung infiltrates + severe progressing hypoxemia, ventilation perfusion mismatch and restrictive lung disease in the absence of <a href="./pulmonary_edema.md#preload">cardiogenic pulmonary edema</a>

definition(berlin definition)  - pao2/fio2 \< 300 with peep/cpap requirement of 5mmhg, b/l opacities, not explained by cardiac diseases(left atrial hypertension/cariogenic pulmonary edema) confirmed by echo and evolving in 1 wk or less   

> Note: The term acute lung injury is abandoned 

## Etiology

* pulmonary causes 
  * **infection** 
  * **aspiration**
* extra-pulmonary sources 
  * **sepsis**
  * **pancreatitis**
  * **shock**
  * trauma
  * massive transfusion
  * drowning
  * drug overdose
  * fat embolism
  * inhalation of toxic fumes
 
use Lung Injury Prevention Score(LIPS) for identifying at risk pts.

> Each patient was screened for 24 predisposing conditions and ALI risk modifiers. Predisposing conditions included shock, aspiration, sepsis, pneumonia, acute abdomen, high-risk trauma (traumatic brain injury, smoke inhalation, near drowning, lung contusion, multiple fractures), and necessity for emergency and high-risk surgeries (thoracic, spine, abdominal, cardiac, aortic vascular). ALI risk modifiers included alcohol abuse, obesity, chemotherapy, diabetes mellitus, smoking, tachypnea, hypoxemia, oxygen supplementation, hypoalbuminemia, and acidosis.

Severity of ards
|ards | pf ratio | mortality |
-------|---------|-----------|
| mild | 200 - 300 | 27% |
| moderate | 100-200 | 32% |
| severe | <100 | 45% |

## Clinical Features

dyspnoea 
hypoxemia - both progressing withing hours  usually within 12-24 hours 
tachypnea
increased work of breathing 
central and peripheral cyanosis due to hypoxemia 
tachycardia
altered mental status 
bibasal/whole lung crepts

## Evaluation

* o2 sat 
* pao2/fio2 ration(pf ratio) 
* ct - to differentiate infitrates as lung vs extra pulmonary - pneumothorax, pleural effusion, mediatinal lymphadenopathy, barotrauma 
* echo - to differentiate from cardiogenic pulmonary edema non invasively
* thoracic bioimpedance/pulse contour analysis - to differentiate from cardiogenic pulmonary edema non invasively
* pulmonary artery catheter measurements(avoid if necessary) -  to differentiate from cardiogenic pulmonary edema invasively
* bronchoscopy - assess pulmonary infection and to obtain culture 
* cbc with dc, metabolic panel, serum mag, serum ca+, phosphorus levels, blood lactate level, coagulatin panel, trop, cardiac enzumes, ckmb - as the patient may progress to multiorgan failure

## Treatment 

supportive 
  1. reducing shunt fraction
  2. increasing oxygen delivery
  3. decreasing oxygen consumption
  4. avoiding further injury
  
mechanical ventilation
reduce fluid overload - diuretics 
nutritional suport via [enteral feeding](./enteral_feeding.md) - high fat low carb with gamma linoleic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid improves oxygenation
bed sore prevention
ecmo as salvage therapy


**Mechanical Ventilation rules - ARDSNet (ARDS Clinical Network Mechanical Ventilation) Protocol**
* tidal volume - 4-8ml/kg of ideal body weight 
> Ideal body weight is computed in men as 50 + (0.91 × [height in centimeters − 152.4]) and in women as 45.5 + (0.91 × [height in centimeters − 152.4])
* rr = up to 35 bpm
* spo2 88 to 95%
* plateau pressure keep \<30cm h2o to reduce barotrauma (to ensure this keep peep and tidal volume as low as possible, increasing the ispiration time, decrease the flow rate and using nm blocks to increase the lung compliance(a salient feature of ards) thus decresing plateau pressure) 
> NOTE: other causes of dec lung compliance - pneumothorax, hemothorax, thoracic compartment syndrome, and intraabdominal hypertension
* ph 7.30-7.45
* insp expt ratio < 1 - can be inversed in certain conditions 
* peep up to 24cm h2o in pts requiring 100% fio2
> newer ventilation strategies - APRV(airway pessure release ventilation) and HFOV(high frequency oscillation ventilation-used in children)
> use cpap, bipap, proportional assist ventilation and high flow nasal cannla - in mild and some mod ARDS
* prone position at least 8hrs a day (watch out for dislodgement of lines and tubes)
* conservative fluid administration

## Differential Diagnosis
• Cardiogenic edema
• Exacerbation of interstitial lung disease
• Acute interstitial pneumonia
• Alveolar hemorrhage
• Acute eosinophilic lung disease
• Organizing pneumonia

## Prognosis
main cause of death sepsis and mods 
survivors do so with near complete return of pulmonary capacity

## Complications 

* Barotrauma from high PEEP
* Prolonged mechanical ventilation -thus the need for tracheostomy
* Post extubation laryngeal edema and subglottic stenosis
* Nosocomial infections
* Pneumonia
* Line sepsis
* Urinary tract infection
* Deep venous thrombosis
* Antibiotic resistance
* Muscle weakness
* Renal failure
* Post-traumatic stress disorder
