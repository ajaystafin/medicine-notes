# RENAL TUBULAR ACIDOSIS

## PHYSIOLOGY OF ACID BASE BALANCE

Three mechanisms: 
1. bicarb reabsorption in the proximal tubule due to Na-H exchange
2. hydrogen ions excretion in the collecting tubule 
3. generation of NH3 the primary urinary buffer

## TYPES

1. type 1 - distal rta
2. type 2 - proximal rta
3. type 3 - mixed rta 
4. type 4 hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism rta/ hyperkalemic rta

## DISTAL RTA

## PROXIMAL RTA
- most common in monoclonal gammopathies (light chain gammopathy), multiple myeloma, amyloidosis
- often associated with fanconi syndrome 
- urine ph is variable
- can alsol occur due to carbonic anhydrase inhibitor

## MIXED RTA

## HYPERKALEMIC RTA
- most common in diabetics - destruction of jg apparatus due to vascular hyalinosis causing hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism
