# ALKALOSIS

## BICARBONATE HOMEOSTASIS

kidney maintains by two mechanisms 
- reabsorption in the prox tubule - na-h antiporter and h+atpase
- bicarb production in the distal nephron

fall of bicarbonate by 4 to 5 mmol/L for every 10 mmHg fall in pCO2.
0.5 mmHg increase in PaCO2 per 1 mmol/L increase in HCO

Alkalemia also causes a shift in the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve towards the left, thus increasing hemoglobin's affinity for oxygen and decreasing oxygen release to the tissues.

When the intake of potassium is suboptimal, this can correlate with metabolic alkalosis due to intracellular sodium and proton levels rising as well as a consequent depression in aldosterone levels.[15] When protons shift into the cellular compartment, metabolic alkalosis ensues; this is followed by respiratory center depression of respiratory drive and ultimately, the purging of bicarbonate by the kidney.

Nonhypochloremic metabolic alkalosis associates with hypertension and is usually the result of syndromes of excess mineralocorticoid production. These generally correlate with signs of volume expansion, hypertension, and hypokalemia.[17] Persistent and projectile, non-bilious emesis in a two to six week old, otherwise well-appearing infant is a hallmark presentation of pyloric stenosis.

When associated with hypoxia or an increased alveolar-arterial (A-a) gradient, respiratory alkalosis requires a search for a cause of hypoxia

Electrolyte disturbances associated with alkalosis such as hypokalemia and hypocalcemia are the chief causes of clinical deterioration in the patient and must undergo correction before the onset of life-threatening complications. 

 Slow acid administration or dialysis with low bicarbonate baths may be necessary for emergent situations
