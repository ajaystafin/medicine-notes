# HENOCH SCHONLEIN PURPURA

- most common childhood vasculitis 
- leukocytoclastic vasculitis - literally means breakdown of neutrophils (histological term for denoting vasculitis involving small vessels most commonly manifesting with a palpable purpura)
- mostly self limiting and harmless - except when concomitatnt nephritis is present which may cause complications (which occurs 1-2 months after onset of HSP)
- manifestations due to iga deposition in skin, gi, joints, kidneys
- steroids effective for rapid resolution of renal, joint and abdominal pain, but not treatment of organ manifestations and complications such as glomerulonephritis, bowel infarction or intussusceptions
- mmf or cyclosporine a better for renal involvement
- cancer screening shld be done in older males with HSP

## DIAGNOSIS:

![criteria](./hsp_criteria.png)

## HISTOLOGY

neutrophilic granulocytes which partly degenerate and form nuclear dust (leukocytoclasia)

on direct immunofluorescence - iga and c3 deposition in vessel wall

## CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS 

**tetrad** - develops over days to weeks
1. **palapable purpura** - 100% pt have purpura - most consistent finding 
	* mostly lower extremities
	* after disappearing leaves hemosiderin deposits - which discolor the skin for weeks
2. **joint pain** - 75% pt have joint pain
	* temp non destructive polyarthralgia, mostly knees and ankles
	* affected joints painful swollen and have reduced function
3. **gi complaints** - 51%
	* abdominal pain most common
	* melena 20% and hemetemesis 2%
	* hypoalbuminemia in the absence of proterinuria shows intestinal involvement
	* complications - perforations, intussuscptions and bowel infarction
4. **renal involvement** - 54%
	* HSPN (hsp nephritis)
	* leading cause of morbidity in hsp
	* isolated microscopic hematuria (most common finding - develops within 4 weeks of disease onset) , mild proteinuria to nephrotic and nephritic syndrome and renal failure
	* hypertension 

- other manifestations -  cerebral vasculitis, testicular haemorrhage
and interstitial pulmonary haemorrhage 

## ETIOLOGY

- URI - strep, parainfluenza, parvovirus b19

## TREATMENT 

- based on presence or absence of renal involvement
- if no renal involvement - symptomatic - pain medication, rehydration, wound therapy for ulceration etc.
- if renal involvement
	* steroids
	* mmf
	* cyclosporine
	* dapsone
	* rituximab - anti cd20 antibody
- others 
	* anticoagulants
	* plasmapheresis
	* tonsillectomy (since hsp is often cause by uri)

> NOTE: HSP AND CANCER - seen in male >60 with rash in trunk and upper extremities - associated with solid tumours of gi, respiratory tract, urinary tract
