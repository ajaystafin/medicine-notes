# ABDOMINAL PAIN - SYMPTOMATOLOGY
[reference](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK412/)

> NOTE: 
> VISCERAL PAIN - splanchnic nerves
> PAREITAL PAIN - cerebrospinal nerves 
> VISCERAL PERITONEUM - no innervation

## ONSET

- SUDDEN
	* perforation of the gastrointestinal tract from a gastric or duodenal ulcer
	* colonic diverticulum
	* foreign body
	* ruptured ectopic pregnancy
	* mesenteric infarction
	* ruptured aortic aneurysm
	* embolism of abdominal vessel.
- RAPID ONSET
	* cholecystitis
	* pancreatitis
	* intestinal obstruction
	* diverticulitis
	* appendicitis
	* ureteral stone
	* penetrating gastric or duodenal ulcer
- GRADUAL ONSET 
	* neoplasm
	* chronic inflammatory processes
	* large bowel obstruction

## PROGRESSION

- intermittent abdominal pain that progresses to a steady constant ache - small bowel obstruction with vascular compromise 
- pain of sudden onset that dramatically reduces - perforated ulcer that has sealed

## MIGRATION 

- acute appendicitis - periumbilical pain replaced with right lower quadrant pain - signifies pareital peritoneum involvement

## CHARACTER

- cramping - mechanical small bowel obstruction (pathognomic) 
	- short pain free interval between cramps - proximal obstruction
	- long pain free interval between cramps - distal obstruction
- constant dull or aching abdominal pain 
	- distension or edema of the wall of hollow viscus
	- pain from stretch of capsule of liver and spleen
- gall bladder colic 
	- hollow viscus distension like cystic duct obstruction - constant dull pain - when the gall bladder contracts - pain intensifies - gall bladder colic

## INTENSITY

- peritoneal pain - peritonitis - pt lays still with knees and hip flexed 
- visceral pain - hollow viscus obstruction - contantly rolls

## LOCALIZATION 

best ascertained by asking the pt to localise while standing 

- visceral pain 
	- poorly localised as epigastric, midabdominal and lower abdominal
	- nausea vominting pallor and sweating associated with visceral pain
- somatic pain 
	- well localized 
	- asymmetricall
	- intensified by jarring, deep inspiration or pressure on the abdomen
	- localise by asking the patient to distend abdomen askign where it pains most and then asking the pt to suck in the abdomen adn asking where its pains most
	- not associated with nause vomiting pallor and sweating

## REFERRED PAIN AND ACCOMPANYNG SYMPTOMS

- dorsal or ventral aspects of dome of diaphragm - referred to supraclavicular fossa (Kehr's sign) (phrenic nerve c3 - c5)
- retroperitoneal inflammation (retrocecal appendicitis or retroperitoneal perforation of duodenal ulcer) - referred to labia, testicle or shaft of penis on involved side - genitofemoral nerve
- incarcerated obturator hernia - referred to medial aspect of thigh to the knee (howship-romberg's sign) - obturator nerve
