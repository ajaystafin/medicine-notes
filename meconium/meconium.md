# MECONIUM
[refernce](https://www.aafp.org/afp/1999/1101/p2043.html)

- passed within 24hrs in 99% healthy term infants
- passed within 9th day in 99% preterms 

## SIGNS OF MECONIUM RETENTION
- bilious vomiting
- distention
- refusal to feed

## EXAMINATION
- anal inspection - anal atresia, perineal fistula with anal atresia, membranous anal atresia and anal stenosis
- x ray - to diagnose obstruction (cant differentiate bt small and large)

## DIFFERENTIALS
- small bowel obstruction (bilious vomiting and abd distension first signs)
	- duodenal atresia
	- ileo-jejenal atresia
	- malrotation
	- volvulus
	- peritonitis
	- meconium ileus (also suspect cystic fibrosis)
	- meconium peritonitis
- large bowel obstruction
	- hirschsprungs disease
	- anorectal malformations
	- meconium plug syndrome
- other 
	- hypoganglionosis
	- neonatal intestinal dysplasia a and b 
	- megacystic microcolon intesitinal hypoperistalsis syndrome

### HIRSCHSPUNGS'S DISEASE
- congential aganglionic megacolon
- boys:girls 4:1
- 8% associated with downs
- anorectal manometry - absent rectosphincteric reflex (distention of rectum results in fall in anal pressure due to inhibition of the anal sphicnter)

>NOTE: A common presentation of Hirschsprung's disease in the newborn is failure to pass meconium during the first few days of life, with subsequent passage of a meconium plug followed by sparse bowel movements

- plain x ray - distension of a segment of bowel
- Gastrointestinal bleeding and diarrhea are danger signs for Hirschsprung's diseaseâ€“associated enterocolitis (due to baceterial proliferation due to stasis)
- barium enema - transition zone with proximal dilated bowel
- barium also present after 24 hour delayed films 
- rectal suction biopsy - absence of ganglion cells and inc acetylcholineesterase staining of the coarse neuronal fibers within musculatin and lamina propria
- rx: surgery - initial colostomy by corrective surgery 3-6months when the baby gains adequate weight

### MECONIUM PLUG SYNDROME
- mild 
- 1 in 500/1000 neonates 
- x ray - gas distension no fluid levels
- contrast enema - shows meconium plug
- rx. - rectal stimulation with thermometer, digital rectal examination or saline enema
> NOTE: passage of meconium following these steps doesnt exclude hirschsprings coz even in hirschsprungs the baby may pass meconium. So **followup necessary**)

### MECONMIUM ILEUS
- bowel obstruction due to thick tenacius meconium
- 30% of cases of intestinal obstruction 
- commonly assoctiated with cystic fibrosis
- also associated wiht atresia, volvulus, perforation
- abd distension with vomiting at bilious vomiting at birth
- visible peristalsis on observation, also palpable 
- Massive distention, abdominal tenderness or abdominal erythema indicates the presence of complications
- xray - air fluid levels
- xray - The presence of calcifications, free air or very large air-fluid levels suggests complications
- contrst enema - bowel with no movements, narrow below obstruction, dilated above obstruciton
- rx. - abminister diatrizoate meglumine (gastrgrafin) enema and iv fluids
- if not working sx

### ANAL STENOSIS
- The anus is very small, and a central black dot of meconium is present.
- The diagnosis of anal stenosis is established by demonstration of a small, tight anus
- rx- [anal dilatation](https://www.med.umich.edu/1libr/PedSurgery/ColorectalProgram/Anal-Dilation.pdf) for several months with hegar dilator

### ANAL ATRESIA
