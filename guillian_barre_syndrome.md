# GUILLIAN BARRE SYNDROME - ACUTE INFLAMMATORY DEMYELINATING POLYNEUROPATHY

- part of a spectrum that consists of 
	- acute (GBS) inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy
	- subacute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy
	- chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy
- post infectious immune diasease
- 1/100,000 incidence 
- multifocal demyelinating disease of peripheral nerves 


## ETIOLOGY

1. campylobacter jejuni
2. cmv
3. ebv
4. certain vaccinations: swine flu, rabies 
5. post opv vaccination 

## PATHOPHYSIOLOGY

- antiganglioside antibodies cross react with campylobacter jejuni lipopolysaccharides in the cell wall

## SUBTYPES 

1. acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy
2. acute motor axonal neuropathy - most commonly asossicated with c.jejuni
3. acute motor and sensory axonal neuropathy - only 5% of cases 
4. miller fischer syndrome - most commonly associated with anti-GQ1b antibody - invlovement of 3,4,6 cranial nerves 

## CRITERIA 

MAJOR: 
1. weakness of more than 2 limbs
2. not progressing for more than four weeks
3. areflexia
4. other causes rules out (lead poisoning, vasculitis, botulism, porphyria)

MINOR:
1. mild sensory signs 
2. raised protein in csf
3. csf cell count relatively normal 
4. neurophysiological evidence of conduction block

## TREATMENT

- good intensive care 
	- mechanical ventilation if needed
	- physiotherapy
	- anticoagulants for thromboembolism prohylaxis
	- passive limb movement to prevent contarctures 
- IVIG shortens time to recovery to around 32 days 
- Plasma exchange removes offending antibodies 

## PROGNOSIS

- 65% recover completely
- 27% some form of disability
- 8% die of arrhythmias or pulmonary emboli
