# LACUNAR SYNDROMES

## Types of syndromes: 
- pure motor hemiparesis
- pure sensory stroke 
- sensori motor stroke 
- dysarthria clumsyhand syndrome
- ataxic hemiparesis

## History:

- symptoms over min to hours with a stuterring course
- no cortical symptoms like - agnosia, aphasia, neglect, apraxia, hemianopsia:
- common in elderly or young with conditions like CADASIL

## Investigations:
- ct/mri
- mri>ct 
- Diffusion weighted image mri > t2 weighter mri/FLAIR sequences 

> **NOTE: mri with features of acute ischemia with h/o dm and ht is all that is needed for diagnosis**

## Treatment/Management:

- same as for stroke: iv alteplase within 4.5 hours - careful monitoring for leeding following alteplase

**
- contraindications for iv alteplase same as for stroke 
- ischemic stroke/head trauma in the past 3 months, previous intracranial hemorrhage, gastrointestinal (GI) malignancy or hemorrhage in the past 21 days, intracranial/spinal surgery in the past 3 months, and intra-axial intracranial neoplasm
**

If not eligible for alteplase use *aspirin* in the first 24 hours 

## Long term Treatment 

- speech and physical therapy
- post stroke start dual antiplateley therapy (asp+prasu or asp+dipyradamol) for 21 days followed by single antiplatelet
- maintain bp at 120/80mm hg 
- high dose statin to keep ldl < 100
- good sugar control with HbA1c < 7 
- sodium reduction 
- weight control
- if done right reduction in stroke of 80%

## Differential Diagnosis:

- Large vessel ischemic stroke(mca territory) - differentiate by ct 
- Intracranial hemorrhage(subarach, subdural, intracererbral hemorrhages) - ct
- Seizures - cortical signs +, weakness recovers 24-48 hours later - EEG may be required
- Complicated migraine events
