# NEUROPATHY

[Reference](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5371025/)

lesion in somatosensory system including peripheral nerves(Ab, Ad and C-  Erlanger and Gasser classification)(peripheral neuropathic pain) and central neurons(central neuropathic pain)

somatosensory nerves arise from skin, muscles, joints and fasica

symptoms like burning and electrical like sensations and pain resulting from non painful stimuli -- leading to sleep distutbances, anxiety and depression

commonly seen in lower backs, lower limbs, neck and upper limbs

lumbar and cervical painful radiculopathies the most common cause of chronic neuropathy

common causes of central neuropathic pain - post stroke pain, neurodegenerative diseases eg. parkinsons
common causes of central neuropathic pain due to spinal cord lesions - spinal cord injury, syringomyelia and demyelinating diseases (multiple sclerosis, transverse myelitis, neuromyelitis optica)

peripheral neuropathic pain - generalised (and symmetric) and localised
 - painful generalized neuropathy - diabetes (10-20% of pts) - due to methylgloxal production - activated na channels in nerve - causing hyperalgesia, pre-diabetes, other metabolic dysfunctions, infection diseases (mainly HIV, leprosy), chemo induced, immune (guillian barre syndrome), inflammatory conditions, inherited neuropathies and channelopathies (inherited erythromelalgia - blood vessels are episodically blocked and become hyperaemic and inflamed) 
 - paingul generalized neuropathy causes glove and stocking pattern of lesions - progressing from distal to proximal
 - if proximal > distal then it may due to sensory ganglia lesions
 
 * painful localized peripheral neuropathies - affects peripheral nerves or nerve roots
   * caused by postherpetic neuralgia, post traumatic neuropathy, post surgical neuropathy, cervical and lumbar radiculopathies, pain associated with HIV/leprosy, diabetes mellitus, complex regionla pain syndrome type 2 and trigeminal neuralgia.
