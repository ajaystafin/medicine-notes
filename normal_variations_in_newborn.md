- milia
- erythema toxicum
- mongolian spots
- cafe au lait spots (if single <3cm in dia)
- harlequin color change (half of the body pink other half white)
- cutis marmorate (temporary lacy reddish or bluish patterns with or without swelling in areas exposed to cold)
- skin peeling
- balding
- vernix caseosa (dont try to remove - sheds on its own while bathing)

**VASCULAR ANOMALIES (!!!may or may not be normal)**
[reference](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3556661/)
**Mulliken glowacki classification of birth mark**

1. hemangiomas
- proliferation of endothelial cells 
- involutes in 95% children
- females>:males 3:1
- **majority appear in the first 3 months of life**, grow rapidly in the first 6months, then starts to involute starting at 12 months and completes by 7 years
- steroids may be used to involute faster (not always effective)
- types 
	- superficial (capillary neves hemangioma)
	- deep (cavernous hemangioma)


2. vascular malformations
- inborn errors of vascular morphgenesis
- **almost always present at birth**
- female=males
- neither proliferative nor involutive but grows with person 
- changes in size are secondary to hemodynamic changes

- **Port wine stain(Nevus Flammeus)**
	- vascular malformation of capillaries, vein and venular channels in the dermis
	- becomes darker with growth of baby
	- **well defined border** (differs from nevus simplex - ill defined borders)
	- present in mesodermal dysplastic syndromes 
	- when present isolated in face(trigeminal distribution) is a minor expression of Sturge Weber Syndrome(port wine stain with assoicated ipsilateral vascualar malformation of leptomeninges and eye) investigate wiht CT)
	- if present in areas other than face - may be normal - treated with vascular laser
- **nevus simplex (stork mark or salmon patch)**
	- vasular malformation with **indistict poorly definedborders** (while port wine stain has a defined border)
	- blanches
	- becomes more prominent while crying or starining
	- common in forehead, glabella, upper eyelid, nape
	- disappear spontaneously in ages of 1 to 3 
	- treatment not required
	
> Treat vascular malformations conservatively or non urgently  except for subglottic or eyelid hemangiomas, hemorrhagic episodes due to ischemic ulcerations and dental arcade AVM with bleeding complications
