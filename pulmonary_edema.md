# Cardiogenic Pulmonary Edema

inc left left heart pressure --> inc pulmonary venous pressure --> inc capillary pressure in lungs --> pulmonary edema

> Note: Interstitial pressure is always negative, keeps the alveoli dry

## Etiology

* Coronary artery disease with left ventricular failure (myocardial infarction)
* **Congestive heart failure**
* Cardiomyopathy
* Valvular heart diseases on the left side of the heart (stenosis and regurgitation)
* Cardiac arrhythmias
* Right to left shunts

## Clinical Features

Acute pulmonary edema will have[11]:

* Excessive shortness of breath worsening on exertion or lying down
* A feeling of the sinking of heart and drowning/anxiety worsening on lying down
* Gasping for breath
* Blueness of lips
* Dizziness and excessive sweating
* A cough may be associated with worsening edema
* Blood tinged/pink colored frothy sputum in very severe disease
* Chest pain (myocardial infarction and aortic dissection)
* Cold, clammy skin

Chronic pulmonary edema will have:

* Shortness of breath on exertion
* Orthopnea
* Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea
* Swelling of the body/lower extremities
* Weight gain
* Fatigue

> Note: Ortner syndrome, which refers to hoarseness due to compression of recurrent laryngeal nerve because of an enlarged left atrium, may also be occasionally present in some patients.

## Physical Examination

* JVP - inc(normal in non cardiogenic)
* BP - hypertenstion/hypotension(shows severe systolic dysfunction)
* RR - tachypnoea, dyspnea, use of accessory muscles of respiration
* Pulse - tachycardia
* Pedal edema - chronic heart failure
* RS - fine crackles at base progressing to top, wheeze may be +
* CVS - murmurs(valvular heart disease), s3 gallop and loud pulmonic component of s2(volume overload)
* GI - tender hepatomegaly in right sided heart failure --> hepatic fibrosis --> hepatic cirrhosis in chronic congestion, ascitis may be present 

## Labs

* cbc - anemia, sepsis
* serum electrolytess - pt on diuretic therapy may have disturbances
* pulse oximetry and abg - hypoxia, acidemia(if acidemia+ then proceed to non invasive ventilation)
* BNP/nt-proBNP - < 100ng/L and < 300 ng/L rules out cardiogenic pulmonary edema
* ECG - rule out mi and arrhythmias
* **CXR** 

> **Early Stage**
> * Cardiomegaly - cardiothoracic ratio over 50%.
> * Broad vascular pedicle
> * Vascular redistribution
> * Cephalization
> **Intermediate Stage**
> * Interstitial edema
> * Kerley B lines
> * Peribronchial cuffing
> * Thickened interlobar fissure    
> **Late Stage**
> * Alveolar edema
> * Perihilar Bat wing appearance
> * Pleural effusion 


* Ultrasound - differentiates copd from ccf as a cause of dyspnoea
* **Echocardiography** - differentiates systolic from diastolic dysfunction/cardiac tamponade/papillary muscle rupture/acure vsd/valvular lesion
* swan ganz catheter - pulmonary capillary wedge pressure

> **note: echo and cxr very imp**

## Treatment 

### Stabilisation
* ABC - Stabilization
A - clear airway
B - o2 saturation
C - vital signs and cardiac assessment 
* prop up
* iv access
* urine output monitoring 
* o2 delivery(only if the o2 sat is <90%/acidemia) - nasal prongs/face mask --> non rebreather mask --> niv --> invasive ventilation(high peep)
> **note:** dont use o2 excessively coz o2 constricts pulmonary vasculature and reduction in cardiac output thus aggravating the condition

### Specific Management

### 1. Treatment of the Underlying Condition

### 2. Non Invasive Management   

<a href='#preload'>* Preload Reduction</a>
<a href='#afterload'>* Afterload Reduction</a>

<h4 id=preload>* Preload Reduction</h4>

* **LOOP DIURETICS** 
  * Dosage
    * pt who haven't used diuretics before + preserved renal function - 20-40mg IV furosemide
    * pt on diuretics - more than double the routine maintenance dose 
    * pt with reduced renal function/severe hf - 160-200mg IV furosemide or 5-10mg/hr drip
> **note:** the dose of diuretic can be doubled after 2 hours if pt not showing improvement in function
  * Monitoring 
    * Daily weight
    * strict i/o chart
    * telemetry
    * rft+se
    * maintain k+ >4mEq/L and Mg > 2mEq/L
    * o2 sat monitoring  
* BIPAP - to move fluid out of the lungs
* *Nesritide - not used* 
* Vasodilator therapy - *Nitrates(Nitroglycerin,isdn)/sodium nitroprusside/morphine (NEVER USE OR USE WITH EXTREME CAUTION COZ CAUSES SYMPTOMATIC HYPOTENSION)*
  * Indication:
    * use if urgent afteload reduction needed 
    * pt not responding to diuretics
    * refractory hf and dec cardiac output
  * Dosage:  
    * Nitrates - veno\>arterial dilator 
    * nitroglycerin - 5-10mcg/min to 200mcg/min(max dose) --adv:short half life
    * isdn --disadv long half life - dont use
    * Sodium Nitroprusside - both art/venous dilator - dosage 5-10mcg/min to 400mcg/min(max dose) --adv effect- cyanide toxicity at higher dosage 
* **Sodium/water restriction**
* vasopressin receptor antagonist(tolvaptan) - use with caution and under supervision
* VTE prophylaxis for acute hf - coz tia and thromboemblism common in acute hf

<h4 id=afterload> * Afterload Reduction</h4>

* ACE/ARB 
* sodium nitroprusside
* beta blocker
* mineralocorticoid antagonists

if bp low in HFpEF - only vasopressor (inotropes are not recommended for HFpEF and dynamic left ventricular obstruction- HOCM)
if bp low in HFrEF 
 - use inotropes - start immediately if bp \< 80 - monitor very closely and evaluate for shock(cold extremities, decreased urine output, confusion)
 - add vasopressors for persistent shock - 

### 3. Invasive Management
* IABP(intra aortic balloon pump) - used as bridge to vad/ bridge to cardiac transplant -adv: cheap
* VAD(ventricular assist devices) - costly, but greater efficiency than iabp
* **(ultrafiltration)** - used in hf resistant to diuretics, very useful in hf but routine use not adviced
* cardiac transplant
* valve replacement for valvular diseases
* pci 
* cabg
* intubation - if not able to maintain saturation and also helps to move fluid out of the lungs

## Differential Diagnosis
* Respiratory failure
* Myocardial ischemia/infarct
* Pulmonary embolism
* Neurogenic pulmonary edema
* High altitude pulmonary edema
* Acute respiratory distress syndrome

 * Thromboembolism (pulmonary embolism, DVT, stroke)
 * Pericarditis
 * Rupture
 * Valvular heart disease
 * Cardiogenic shock
