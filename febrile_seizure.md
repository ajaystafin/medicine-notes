# FEBRILE SEIZURE
[reference](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6052913/)

- most common neurologic disorder in childhood
- 6 months to 5 years of age...peak at 12-18 months 
- incidence more in the winter months and in the afternoon (does it apply anywhere?????)
- caused by fever greater than 38 C without any definable cause of seizure (infection, head trauma, epilepsy, elec imbalance, hypoglycemia, drug use, drug withdrawal) or past history of afebrile seizure 

## ETIOLOGY

- height of the temperature rather than the rapidity of the rise in the temperature is the most significant risk factor
- most common cause is viral infections 
	- viral infections 
		- roseola infantum (exanthem subitum)
		- influenza A 
		- human coronavirus
	- shigella gastroenteritis
	- vaccines
		- DTaP
		- IPV
		- Hib
		- inactivated influenza vaccines
- prematurity, postanatal steroids, prenatal nicotine/alcohol, traffic noise exposure, air pollution are other risk factors
- iron deficiency, zinc deficiency
- past history of febrile seizure, febrile seizure in a first-degree relative, intrauterine growth retardation, staying in a neonatal nursery >28 days, neurodevelopmental delay, and daycare attendance

## CLINICAL FEATURES

- within first 3 days of fever (if > 3 suspect other causes)
- most have temps >39 C
- loss of consciousness (not seen in shivering - so use to differentiate)
- foaming at mouth (facial muscle involvement) (also not seen in shivering)
- difficulty breathing (respiratory muscle involvement) (also not seen in shivering)
- pallor 
- cyanosis

- types 
	- simple 
	- complex
- simple febrile seizure
	- generalized 
	- tonic clonic movemnts (not seen in febrile delirium)
	- rolling back of eyeballs(not seen in febrile delirium) 
	- few sec to at most 15 mins (usually less than 5 mins)
	- brief post ictal drowsiness 
	- does not recur within 24 hours
- complex febrile seizures
	- >15 mins 
	- focal involment (one side of body or one limb)
	- recur within the same day 
	- prolonged post ictal drowsiness/postictal transient hemiparesis(Todd's Palsy)
	- occurs in younger children with developmental delay
	- children with simple febrile seizure may subsequently have complex febrile seizure
	- febrile status epilepticus - most severe form of complex seizures - seizures without regaining consciousness for more than 30mins - may lead to hippocampal abnormalities

## CLINICAL EVALUATION

<code>A detailed history should be taken to find out the cause of the fever, the relationship of the onset of fever to the seizure, the characteristics of fever including the peak temperature and duration, seizure semiology, and duration of postictal drowsiness.10 The history also should include personal history of prior seizure and whether the child was recently vaccinated, attended day care, or treated with an antimicrobial agent. Fever is common in the pediatric age group and may occur coincidentally with a more serious underlying cause of seizure. Therefore, enquiry should be made about immunization status, potential exposures to infection, toxin ingestion, CNS trauma, developmental milestones, prior seizures, and history of febrile and afebrile seizures in other family members.10 </code>

history to  find out cause of fever - ear infecton, pharyngitis, uri, tonsillitis

meningitis (irritability, depressed sensotium, nuchal rigidiity, bulging or tense fontanelle, kernig and brudzinski)

formal neurological examination (consciousness, tone, power, reflexes) and note focal abnormalitites

fundus examination - to rule out inc intracranial pressure

- neurocutaneous markers
	- port-wine stain - sturge weber syndrome, 
	- tuberous sclerosis
		* shagreen or leather patches 
		* facial angiofibromas
		* periungual fibromas (koenen tumours)
		* ash leaf spots (hypopigmented macules) 
	- neurofibromatosis
		* cafe au lait spots 
		* intertriginous freckling
		* iris hamartomas (lisch nodules)
		* cutaneous or sub cutaneous nodules

## DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
- shivering (no loss of consciousness, facial or respiratory muscle involvement)
- febrile delirium (no tonic clonic movements of limbs or rolling back of eyeballs)
- breatch holding spells (brief, involuntary cessation of breathing that occur in children in response to stimuli such as anger, frustration, pain, or fear...two types - cyanotic and pallid...loss of consciousness+, no tonic clonic movements, rolling of eyeballs)
- cns infection like meningitis, enchepalitis (fever+,seizure+,altered consciousness, petechial rash, nuchal rigidity, kernig, brudzinski)
- febrile myoclonus (benign disorder, affects 6m-6years) - myoclonic jerks of mostly upper limb during fever - may last 15 min to several hours
- GEFS+ (generalized/genetic epilepsy with febrile seizures+) - seizure even beyond 6 years and afebrile seizures also present which could be myoclonic, atonic, absence
- new onset refractory status epilepticus (NORSE) (clinical presentation, but not a specific diagnosis, in a patient without active epilepsy or other existing relevant neurological disorder, with new onset of refractory status epilepticus in the absence of a clear acute or active structural, metabolic, or toxic cause.)
- febrile infection related epilepsy syndrome (FIRES)- subset or NORSE that requires a febrile infection between 24 hours and 2 weeks prior to refractory status epilecticus with or without fever at the onset of status epilepticus and with no restiction to the age of the patient

## INVESTIGATIONS
- LP not necessary routinely (do if meningitis is suspected - Pleocytosis, low glucose level, and high protein level in the cerebrospinal fluid are indicative of bacterial meningitis, necessitating the need for culture of the cerebrospinal fluid.)
- AAP strongly urges clinicians to consider a lumbar puncture in children <12 months of age who present with a febrile seizure, especially if the immunization status for Hib and Streptococcus pneumoniae is unknown or deficient - because defficult to differentiate febrile seizures from other conditions in this age group
- EEG not routinely recommended (consider in complex febrile seizures, afebriles seizures, recurrent febrile seizures wiht developemental delays or neurological deficits)
- CT, MRI not recommended ( use in focal neurological abnormalities, suspected structural deect, abnormally large heads and severe head injury)

## PROGNOSIS
- self limiting
- one third have recurrence lt 3times
- 10% have recurrence gt 3 times
- 75% recurrences occur within 1 year, 90% within 2 years
- risk factors for recurrence 
	- age of onset <15 months
	- relatively lower temperature at the time of the first febrile seizure
	- shorter interval (less than 1 hour) between the onset of fever and the initial seizure
	- febrile seizure and epilepsy in a first-degree relative
	- day-care attendee
	- frequent febrile illnesses
	- multiple febrile seizures during the same febrile illness
	- a first febrile seizure that is complex
	- neurodevelopmental delay

## MANAGEMENT
- not needed if no seizure had stopped before reaching hospital
- if ongoing seizure
	- IV lorazepam(0.05-0.1 mg/kg) or IV diazepam (0.1 to 0.2mg/kg) - mostly stops - can be repeated after 5 mins if doesnt stop within 5 mins
	- if continues - fosphenytoin 20mg PE/pheno at 20mg/kg IV ... if continues repeat fosphenytoin 10mg PE after 10mins or give pheno 20mg/kg or valproic acid 20mg/kg or levitaracetam 20mg/kg
	- When the intravenous route is unavailable or inaccessible, diazepam administered rectally (0.5 mg/kg), buccally (0.5 mg/kg), or intranasally (0.2 mg/kg) and midazolam administered buccally (0.2 mg/kg) or intranasally (0.2 mg/kg) are safe and effective alternatives

- monitor vitals 
- o2 for through nasal canual, hood, face mask to maintain spo2 gt 92%
- antipyretic if fever is high enough to cause discomfort to the child
