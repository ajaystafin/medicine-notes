# VENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA 
most common cause of Sudden Cardiac Death(SCD)
> Sudden Death: non-traumatic unexpected fatal event occurring 1 hr within symptom onset in an apparently health adult / 24 hrs in an unwitnessed death
> SUDS: sudden death in which an autopsy has not been performed(SUDI in infants) 
> SCD: sudden death with congenital or acquired potentially fatal cardiac condition is known/autopsy shows cardiac or vascular anomaly /no obvious extracardiac cause have been identified resulting in an arrhythmia taken as the cause of death 
> SADS: sudden death in which autopsy shows normal heart and non cardiac etiologies have been excluded(SIDS in infants)
most common Wide Complex Tachycardia(WCT)
98% of pts with wct with prior mi - vt 

## TYPES
non sustained vt - < 30s 
sustained monomorphic vt - > 30s 
polymorphic vt - everchanging qrs complexes (TdP is a type of polymorphic vt that is preceded by a long qt interval in sinus rhythm)
ventricular fibrillation - irregular undiscernable qrs complexes

## ETIOLOGY
associated with structural diseases
* ischemic
* non ischemic cardiomyopathy
* infiltrative cardiomyopathy
* surgeries for congenital heart diseases
* arrythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia 
* bundle branch reentry vt 
* device mediated WCT - due to pacemaker or implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD)
not associated with structural diseases
* inherited ion channelopathies - brugada and long qt 
* catecholaminergic vt 
* idiopathic vt (diagnosis of exclusion)
* class 1 and class 3 antiarrhythmic drugs - and other drugs that cause qt prolongation
* drugs such as  potassium sparing diuretics, loop diuretics, digoxin

## DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
wct is usually due svt with aberracy or vt 
other dd
* pacemaker induced tachycardia 
* antidromic avrt 
* hyperkalemia induced tachycardia 

## ECG
* av dissociation or fusion beats 
* absence of rs morphology in precordial leads 
* lbbb morphology with right axis deviation 
* in tthe absence of these features rs interval in precordial leads > 100msec is consistent with vt 

## TREATMENT
* antiarrhythmic agent
* icd implantation - can be used for all causes of scd(sudden cardiac death)
* rfa(radio frequency ablation) in case of pts with idiopathic vt in a structurally normal heart 
* immediate unsynchronised dc cardioversion for pulseless vt and vf
* Drugs- in case refractort o defibrillation
  * first line drugs 
    + iv lidocaine< iv amiodarone(takes atleast 5days to start action; arrythmia effectively controller only after 4-6 weeks of therapy) 
    + continue iv drugs after successful defivrillation until a reversible cause has been identified 
    + drugs can be used in pts with icd to prevent frequent discharges of the icd 
    + beta blockers /ace administered after control of vt/vf to reduce the incidence of mortality and scd(sudden cardiac death)
  * second line drugs 
    * sotalol (class 3)- chronic rx
> NOTE: avoid class 1 agents exccept lidocaine(1b) 
    * mexiletine - similar to lidocaine but oral form
    * phenytoin for digitalis induced vt 
    * class 4 agents no role 
> NOTE: rx for vt in mi is complete revascularization - for all other rx the chance of recurrence is same 
> NOTE: For TdP wiuth long qt syndrome the rx is defibrillaiton; bolus magsulf may be effective, shorten the qt interval by inc the hr to 90-120 bpm with iv isoproterenol starting at 1-2mcg/min or temp transvenous pacing
