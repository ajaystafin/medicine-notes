![af anticoagulation](./anticoagulation_in_af.png)
recommended inr for pts with af - 2-3

> NOTE: major risk of bleed starts at INR >3.5
## REVERSAL

> NOTE: antiplatelets should be discontinued when an anticoagulant is used

![reversal](./anticoagulants_reversal.png)

if inr 5-8 reversal is achieved by withholding one or two doses of warfarin followed by dose reduction (in some cases oral vit k can be used). if inr > 8 vit k 1-5 mg

for more urgent reversal of warfarin - four factor pcc(prothrombin complex concentrate)

ufh - protamine sufate - slow iv bolus - 1mg neutralises 80-100 units of ufh (note: in excess protamine sufate is an anticoagulant, derived from fish sperm so be careful with fish allergies and following vasectomy)

lmwh - 1mg per 100 units of lmwh

fondaparinaux - no known reversal agent, recombinant activated factor 8 can be tried as unlicensed indication

direct thrombin  antagonists - idaracizumab - dabigatran ; argatroban - has short half life of 45 min - so stopping the infusion achieves reversal

factor xa inhibitors - no licensed reversal agents ; tranexamic acid and supportive measures ; pcc can be tried ; future prospects(edoxaban - ciraparantag ; xa inhibitors - andexanet alfa)
