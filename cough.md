# COUGH

acute cough following uri lasts for 3 wks
subacute - 3-8 wks 
chronic cough > 8 wks

## MECHANISM OF COUGH

through chemo and mechanoreceptors
to brainstem - nucleus tractus solitarius and spinal trigmeinal tract 
second order neurons to spinal respiratory circuit --> efferent cough response 

## CAUSES OF CHRONIC COUGH

* upper respiratory tract infection - cough upto 8wks - due to transient airway hyperresponsiveness
* upper airway cough syndrome (UACS -new name of post nasal drip), 
* gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), 
* cough-variant asthma,
* eosinophilic bronchitis,
* mediastinal tumor,
* pleural disease,
* early interstitial fibrosis,
* use of an angiotensin converting enzyme-inhibitor (ACEI), and psychogenic and idiopathic (or unexplained) cough.
* lung cancer - productive cough 
* tuberculosis - productive cough 
* left sided heart failure 
* bronchiectasis - purulent sputum
* smoking - productive cough
* lung abscess - sudden productive cough in a febrile pt 
* pneumococcal pneumonia- rust colore sputum
* klebsiella pneumonia - current jelly, sticky sputum
* pulmonary edema - foamy, blood tinged sputum 
* bordatella - cough and vomiting 

## ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT

### uacs 
* a course of antihistaminics(1st gen) or decongestants may diagnose uacs 
* nasal steroids for 2-8 wks can be used for selected cases of rhinitis 
* if pts dont respond to empirical therapy - sinus imaging(ct preferably) can be done 

### cough variant asthma and naeb(non asthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis)
* cough-variant asthma also do not respond to uacs rx
* non-asthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis (naeb) also does not respond to uacs rx - but no variable airway obstruction and bronchial hyper-responsiveness
* if cough variant asthma and naeb cant be ruled out by objective tests a course of empirical steroids can be used t orule out astma or naeb

### gerd
75% of pts with gerd mediated cough dont present with heartburn, acid regurgitation, water brash and so on 

### sleep apnoea

### vocal cord dysfunction

## TREATMENT

 antitussives 
* centrral acting
  * codeine 
  * pholcodeine
  * dextromethorphan
  * methadone
  * morphine
* peripheral acting 
  * demulcents 
  * local anaesthetics (ligno, benzo, tetra, hexylcaine hydrochloride)
  * humidifying aerosols
