# APPENDICITIS 
develops in the 5th week of gestation

## Etiology
mechanical obstruction of lumen
* appendicolith
* tumors 
* parasites 
* hypertrophic lymphoid tissue

## Epidimeology
affects ages 5-45 mean 28 mostly male 

> Note: aerobic organisms during early infection and anerobic later -- common organisms include ecoli, peptosteptococcus, bacteroides, pseudomonas

## Positions of the Appendix 
retrocecal (most common), subcecal, [pre,post] ileal, pelvic 

> note: external rotation/passive extension of the right leg in the left lateral decubitus position - psoas sign - retroceccal appendicitis - rare sign

> note : pain on internal rotation of the right hip - pelvic appendicitis - rare sign

The risk of rupture is variable but is about 2% at 36 hours and increases about 5% every 12 hours after that.
