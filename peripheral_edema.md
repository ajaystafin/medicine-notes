# PERIPHERAL EDEMA

## ETIOLOGY 

### Increased Capillary Hydrostatic Pressure
* Regional venous hypertension (often unilateral)
	+ Deep vein thrombosis
	+ Compartment syndrome
	+ [Chronic venous insufficiency](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK430975/)
* Systemic venous hypertension (often bilateral)
	- Heart failure
	- Pericarditis
	- Pulmonary hypertension
	- Liver failure/cirrhosis  
* Increased plasma volume
	- Pregnancy
	- Premenstrual edema
	- Renal failure
	- Heart failure
	- Drugs
### Decrease Plasma Oncotic Pressure
* Protein loss
	+ Nephrotic syndrome
	+ Preeclampsia/eclampsia
* Reduced protein synthesis
	+ Malnutrition/malabsorption
	+ Liver failure/cirrhosis
	+ Vitamin deficiencies
* Increased Capillary Permeability
	- Burns
	- Insect bites
	- Cellulitis
	- Allergic reactions
* Lymphatic Obstruction
	- Filariasis
	- Malignancy involving lymph nodes leading to obstruction
	- Postsurgical after lymphadenectomy/radiation
* Others
	+ Myxedema in hypothyroidism
	+ Lipedema
	+ Idiopathic
