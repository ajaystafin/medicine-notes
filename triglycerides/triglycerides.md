# HYPERTRIGLYCERIDEMIA
[normal levels](https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/files/docs/guidelines/atglance.pdf)

aka triacylglycerol
sources 
- exogenous from food (carried by chylomicrons)
- endogenous from liver (carried by VLDL- very low density lipoproteins)

in capillaries within fat and muscle tissue these lipoproteins are hydrolyzed to fatty acids 

inc in triglyceride rich lipoproteins caused by 
- inc production in liver and intestine
- decreased catabolism (mainly by reduced lipoprotein lipase activity)

## NORMAL LEVELS
[normal levels](./cholesterol_guideliens.pdf)
## TYPES 

1. primary
2. secondary

## Primary Hypertriglyceridemia

familial chylomicronemia - type 1 and primary mixed hyperlipidemia - type 5

difference 
- type 1 children type 5 adults
- type 1 rarer than type 5
- higher total cholesterol in type 5 
- apo c2 def in type 1 than type 5
clinical features
- eruptive xanthomata - buttocks, trunk, extremities
- tuberous xanthoma - extensor surfaces (seen in type 3)
- palmar crease xanthoma - palmar crease (pathognomic of type 3)
- lipemia retinalis
- hepatosplenomegaly
- focal neurological symptoms like irritability
- recurrent epigastric pain with inc risk of pancreatitis

familial hypertriglyceridemia (hyperlipoproteinemia type 4)
- isolated vldl elevation
- most common among triglyceridemia (5-10% of population)
- 250 to 800 md/dl tgl, low hdl
- inc risk of cvd, obesity, insulin resistance, diabetes, hypertension, hyperuricemia

familial combined hyperlipoproteinemia(type 2b)
- autosomal dominant with variable penetrance
- prevalence 2-5%
- inc vldl and ldl with dec hdl associated with abnormal lipoprotein profile in atleast one first-degree relative

familial dysbetalipoproteinemia (type 3)
- prevalence 1-2 in 20000
- inc beta vldl or idl(intermediate density lipoprotein) elading to equimolar elevation of total cholesterol and triglycerides
- dec ldl inc vldl:tgl ratio
- apo e2 affected - diagnostic
- tuberous or tuberoeruptive xanthomata on externsor surfaces 
- palmer crase xanthomata
- inc risk of cvd

## SECONDARY HYPERTRIGLYCERIDEMIA

1. obesity
2. metabolic syndrome 
3. diabetes
4. alcohol
5. renal disease 
6. prengnancy - not pathologic, no consequences
7. nafld
> NOTE:
> 1,2,3,4 - vldl inc
> 5 ldl inc
> 7 inc tfl dec hdl
8. hypothyroidism
9. paraproteinemias(macroglobulinemia, myeloma, lymphoma, lymphocytic leukemia)
10. autoimmune disorders(sle)
11. haart - ritonavir and lopinavir most associated
12. 2nd gen antipsychotics (clozapine olanzapine - most; risperidone and quetiapine - intermediate) - so monitor every year for weight gain and fasting glucose and lipoprotein levels
