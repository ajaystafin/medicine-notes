# CONSANGUINOUS MARRIAGE 
In clinical genetics, a consanguineous marriage is defined as a union between two individuals who are related as second cousins or closer, with the inbreeding coefficient (F) equal or higher than 0.0156 (Bittles 2001), where (F) represents a measure of the proportion of loci at which the offspring of a consanguineous union is expected to inherit identical gene copies from both parents. This includes unions termed first cousins, first cousins once removed and second cousins.

## AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE 
affected categories - p/p 
unaffected categories - P/P or P/p
eg. albinism

* **appears in the progeny of unaffected parents**
* **no gender predominance** - autosomal inheritance not x linked 

## AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT 
affected categories - P/P or P/p
unaffected categories - p/p
for eg.  achondroplasia
> Note: P/P is usually lethal so most individuals are P/p 

* both genders are affected - not x linked 
* abnormal alleles are found in every generation
