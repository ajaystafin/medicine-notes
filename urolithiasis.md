- risk same as non pregnant women coz increased levels of na,uric acid and ca is counteracted by inc excretion of citrate magnesium and glycoproteins
- calcium abosorption inc due to suppression of parathyroid gland and inc active vit d levels
- ureteric > renal
- symptoms common at 5 months  - colic, tenderness, fever, hematuria
- complications - spontaneous abortion, premature labor, lbw infants
- treatment - conservative - analgesics and antispasmodics (nsaids after 30 weeks is contraindicated coz premature closure of ductus arteriosus
- nsaids in the second trimester may cause lbw, in the 3rd trimester causes asthma at 18months in child)

	- if fever and pyuria - insert dj stent(changed every 4-6 wks to avoid encrustation) -- removed after complete removal of stone post partum
	-if no urosepsis	- ureteroscopic stone removal - pneumatic lithotripsy preferred 
	postpartum - xray kub - ESWL- extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy(contrindi in pregnancy coz shock waves cause fetal death)

*******NOTE: fetal exposure to <1 rad is safe and risk of anomalies for 5rad is negligible. only doses above 15 rad pose risk*********
