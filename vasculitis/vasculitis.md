## DIAGNOSIS

### SYSTEMIC SIGNS/SYMPTOMS

* Fever of unknown origin (FUO): In many cases, the patient experiences a high, spiking fever of 38‐39°C.
* Weight loss caused by inflammation.
* Weakness, general malaise.
* Arthralgia, muscle pains: This systemic manifestation indicates that vasculitis has spread systemically, while localized manifestations result from insufficient supply of local blood flow caused by the inflammation of blood vessels. Histological study with biopsy is recommended in cases of localized myalgia.

> NOTE: these are the sympotoms of malignancy also. so screen for malignancies also
